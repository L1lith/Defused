# Sandforms
Sandforms makes working with forms a breeze.

#### Input Validation
Sandforms uses [Sandhands](https://github.com/L1lith/Sandhands) to provide advanced input validation. To read more about the validation options see the [strings format](https://l1lith.github.io/Sandhands/format) in the Sandhands documentation.

### Compatability
Currently Sandforms only supports react, however there are plans for vanilla JS support in the future.

## React
Sandforms provides a Form component that will automatically detect string based input elements inside it and apply sanitation options (see the string options [here](https://l1lith.github.io/Sandhands/format)) to them based on the props passed to those elements. The form accepts a callback for receiving the submit event using the onSubmit prop. You can handle errors generated by the input validation using the form or inputs onError prop

#### Installation
```
npm i -s sandforms-react
```

#### Example Usage
```js
import {Form} from 'sandforms-react'
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Login extends React.Component {
  submit({username, password}) {
    	console.log(`Got username "${username}", and password "${password}".`)
  }
  error(error){
  	console.log(`Got error "${error}")
  }
	render() {
    return (
      <Form onSubmit={this.submit} onError={this.error}>
      	<input name="username" minLength={3} maxLength={25} regex={/^[a-zA_Z0-9]+$/}/>
        <input name="password" type="password" minLength={8}/>
      </Form>
    )
  }
}
export default Login
```
